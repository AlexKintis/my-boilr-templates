# Do what you have to do to build the image
# Maybe export to the path the desired command
# For example:
export PATH=$PATH:/the/path/to/my-command

# Create a directory to mount the host's directory
mkdir -p /pwd
# Set the working directory to the mounted directory
WORKDIR /pwd

# And then add as an entrypoint the command that will be executed
ENTRYPOINT [ "{{CommandName}}" ]
